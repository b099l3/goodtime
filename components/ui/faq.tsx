    question: "Do I need sign up/pay",
    answer:
      "No, just show up if you fancy it, no need to let us know if you’re coming. The runs are completely free.",

    question: "Do you do any longer runs/other events?",
    answer:

  {
    question: "Is there a set pace?",
    answer:
      "No, we’ll run as a group, or several smaller groups, but you won’t run alone. First time? Just make sure you let someone know and we’ll make sure someone sticks by you. If you need to slow down someone will slow with you, if you need to walk someone will walk with you.",
